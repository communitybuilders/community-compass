## Community Compass

Community Compass is a platform that incorporates years of thinking by the
team at Community Builders but was initially developed in just 45 hours at
GovHack 2015.

The platform, as it was submitted at the end of the competition, is available
in the 'govhack' branch.

We may continue to complete features in this master branch or take them
private for the 'grand reveal'.
